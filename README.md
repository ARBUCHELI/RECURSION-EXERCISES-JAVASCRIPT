# What is a recursive function?

<strong>A recursive function is a function designed to call itself directly or indirectly</strong>. Using recursion, <strong>a problem can be solved by returning the 
value call of the same particular function</strong?.

<strong>A recursive function needs to be terminated at some point</strong>. The return of a recursive function is usually based on internal conditions which forwards 
the logic down to a new iteration until the base case is met.

## Base cases in recursive functions.
In recursive functions, the base case is that <strong>iteration of a recursive function that does not need an additional recursion to solve a problem</strong>.

Base cases are mandatory on recursive functions. <strong>Without a base case a recursive function will never terminate leading it to an infinite loop</strong>.
